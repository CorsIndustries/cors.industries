Are you looking for a simple pot? 
Try my first designed pot: a new home for a cactus, a design coin tray or whatever you want!

This pot is quite robust because doesnâ€™t require the vase mode.

The original dimension are: height 10cm, base diameter 10,8cm, hole diameter: 6,7cm.

My suggestion is to fill it with a little plant and place it to create a very cute and cozy house spot!

If you like colours, you can print it with some beautiful eSUN PLA colour (Amazon links below) to add colour to your spot!

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '10px', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
    <Image src={spiral_pot} alt="A beautiful pot" height="300" width="300" />
</div>
