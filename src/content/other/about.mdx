Cors Industries is a blog created for those who, like us, dream of mastering computer science, electronics, and robotics, one circuit at a time.

If you’ve ever thought “Hello World” was just the beginning of an epic adventure worthy of Frodo, you’re in the right place. Between code that won’t compile and a microcontroller that thinks it’s a Jedi, we explore everything that makes this world a paradise for nerds and makers.

### Why Cors Industries?
The name sounds a bit like a mega-corporation from a dystopian cyberpunk future, doesn’t it? Don’t worry, we don’t have secret plans to take over the world… yet. In reality, we’re here to share projects, guides, experiments (some more successful than others), and a hefty dose of nerdy humor.

What you’ll find here:

- Computer Science: From optimizing code to how not to break everything with `rm -rf`.
- Electronics: Circuits that don’t go up in smoke (well, usually).
- Robotics: Smart machines, one step closer to our personal droid army.

### Our Philosophy

Knowledge, passion, and… memes! We believe the best way to learn is by having fun. After all, as Gandalf once said, “Not all those who wander are lost”… but good documentation sure helps.

### Who We Are

We’re [C](https://github.com/binaryBard73) and D, two enthusiastic makers!
Picture us as Yzma and Kronk in the lab, only instead of strange potions and wrong levers, we’ve got an oscilloscope, two 3D printer and a cat!
Oh, we almost forgot about the third maker: L! The llama!
